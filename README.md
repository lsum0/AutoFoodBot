## 1. Overview :

This project aims to design and implement a **fully autonomous robotic system** to operate inside a **food warehouse**. The robot will manage all logistical operationsâ€”including storing, retrieving, and transporting goodsâ€”without any human intervention.

By combining robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation, the system enhances operational efficiency, hygiene, and safety within food storage environments.

##  2. Objectives :

- Automate all warehouse tasks (picking, storing, transporting)
- Ensure food safety and compliance with hygiene standards
- Eliminate human labor in daily warehouse operations
- Support various zones: dry storage, cold storage, and dispatch areas

---

## 3.  System Architecture :

The system is composed of:

- **Mobile Robot Platform**: Equipped with wheels, sensors, and onboard control.
- **Robotic Arm (6-DOF)**: For picking and placing food containers or packages.
- **Soft Gripper**: Food-safe material to grip crates and delicate packaging.
- **Vision System**: Camera and LIDAR for navigation, object detection, and shelf scanning.
- **AI Decision Engine**: Controls path planning, task execution, and inventory logic.
- **WMS Integration**: Syncs with a Warehouse Management System via IoT.

---

## 4.  Implementation Algorithm :

1. **Initialize System**
   - Boot robot, perform system check, connect to WMS
2. **Load Task Queue**
   - Receive tasks such as "Pick Item A from Shelf 3"
3. **Navigate to Target Location**
   - Use SLAM and LIDAR to map and avoid obstacles
4. **Scan and Identify Item**
   - Computer vision + barcode scanning
5. **Pick or Place Item**
   - Align arm, activate gripper, execute operation
6. **Update Inventory in WMS**
   - Log task completion
7. **Repeat Until All Tasks Are Complete**
8. **Return to Charging Dock if Battery < 15%**
